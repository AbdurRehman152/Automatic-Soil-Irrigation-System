# Automatic-Soil-Irrigation-System
This project is on automatic plant watering system using a microcontroller TM4C123GH6PM.
Introduction:                                                                                                                                                                         Now a dayâ€™s water is becoming very precious due to scarcity in obtaining clean water for domestic purpose including irrigation. In order to optimize the use of water, mechanism to develop water conversation is the need of the hour. To overcome this problem here we will be going to build an Automatic Plant watering system that automatically waters the plants without any human effort. This system continuously senses the moisture levels of the plant soil. When the soil moisture levels will decrease this device automatically water the plants. This system not only saves your time, it also saves the wastage of water. This system is also known as the Automatic Plant Irrigation System.
